Notes on ReC Thorium Reactor
============================

* Take lithium (skimmed from hell), mix w/ emerald dust and
   fluorite in uranium processor, get LiFBe.

* Take LiFBe, mix w/ fluorite and thorium dust in fuel
   enhancer (RoC), get thorium fuel.
   
 + NOTE: COVER ANY THORIUM FUEL RESERVOIRS!
         IF THINGS FALL INTO IT, RESERVOIRS
         WILL BLOW THE FUCK UP.

* Thorium fuel cores use fuel lines, not regular fluid
   pipes (steel/bedrock).

* EIO max fluid conduits can handle multiple fluid types
   at once, for liquid waste and hot LiFBe Fuel transport.
   
======================
HOW DOES THORIUM WORK?
======================

* Takes LiFBe Fuel salts from the top, outputs fluid
   waste and hot LiFBe Fuel from the bottom.

* Can dump heat into lithium-filled water cells; methinks
   this is for cooling purposes and NOT for generating
   useable hot fluids.

* When a neutron hits a thorium core:

 + If neutron is breeder, nothing happens.

 + If neutron is a thermal neutron, interaction chance
    is 100%; if it is fast or otherwise, interaction
    chance is 60%.

 + There is also a Cos-interpolated chance of interaction,
    bounded at 400 and 1,200C, inclusive, based on the
    current temperature.

 + If all this checks out:

  - If the fuel core doesn't have fuel, do nothing. (Duh)

  - If it does have fuel, chances of a neutron are:
     25 - 20 * sqrt((temp - minTemp) / (maxTemp - minTemp))

  - If THAT checks out, the core loses 100mB of LiFBe
     salts, adds 100mB of hot LiFBe, adds +20C, and
     spawns a neutron burst.

  - There is a 5% chance that 50mB of waste is created
     during this process.

* The thorium fuel core requires minimum 400C to operate.
